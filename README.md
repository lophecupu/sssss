"chmod 777 [path to the file]/newfile.txt" in the terminal.

3.turn on apache server

4.access login page using localhost/[filename]/Facebook_Log_In_or_Sign_Up.html


user credentials will be stored inside a text file called newfile and that text file will be stored inside the same folder.
In sendEmail.php file I have commented out sendmail() option. The reason is for that is when you run sendEmail.php l
ocally (localhost) in order to send an email you have to configure a mail server(Gmail, yahoo, hotmail etc).You can do this 
manually using php_init file.Since it takes little bit more knowledge and some time we go with the easy option which is 
creating a file and wrting credentials to it. But when we are doing the real phishing we use a free hosting site which is 
capable of sending emails.So when hosting the phishing website you can go with any of those methods. 


This is my blog post about phishing.Read and follow instructions.
